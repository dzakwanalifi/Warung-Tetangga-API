- **Health Check**: Test system status endpoint

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_payments.py -v
```

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

## Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests**: 21 tests
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Coverage**: Core payment functionality, authentication, and API endpoints
- **External Dependencies**: Mocked (Tripay API, Supabase Auth)

## Key Testing Features

### 1. **Mock-Based Testing**
- All external API calls are mocked to prevent dependencies
- Tripay API responses are simulated for various scenarios
- Database operations use SQLite for fast, isolated testing

### 2. **Error Handling Coverage**
- Network timeouts and connection errors
- HTTP 401, 500, and other status codes
- JSON parsing failures and malformed responses
- Database transaction failures

### 3. **Payment Status Testing**
- Complete payment lifecycle from creation to completion
- Status synchronization between local database and Tripay
- Payment failure handling with automatic rollbacks

### 4. **Backward Compatibility**
- Tests ensure alias functions maintain compatibility
- Legacy endpoint behavior is preserved

### 5. **Webhook Security Testing** ✅ **NEW**
- HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- Request body verification
- Duplicate webhook detection
- Race condition prevention with database locking

## Database Testing Strategy

### SQLite Test Database
- Uses in-memory SQLite for fast test execution
- Recreated for each test function to ensure isolation
- Compatible models that mirror PostgreSQL production schema

### Test Data Management
- Fixtures provide clean database state for each test
- No persistent data between test runs
- Automatic cleanup after test completion

## Mocking Strategy

### External API Mocking
- **Tripay API**: All payment gateway calls are mocked
- **Gemini AI**: Image analysis requests are mocked
- **Azure Blob Storage**: File upload operations are mocked

### Database Mocking
- Uses dependency injection to override database sessions
- SQLite in-memory database for fast, isolated tests
- Transaction rollback on test failures

## Future Testing Enhancements

### Planned Additions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real external services in staging
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for payment processing endpoints
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing for authentication and payment flows
- **Webhook Load Testing**: High-volume webhook processing tests
- **Race Condition Stress Tests**: Concurrent user interaction testing

### Testing Tools to Consider
- **pytest-asyncio**: For async endpoint testing
- **pytest-benchmark**: For performance testing
- **pytest-mock**: Enhanced mocking capabilities
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing for edge cases

## Dependencies

### Testing Libraries

## Notes

### Known Limitations
- Geographic queries are simplified for SQLite compatibility
- Some PostGIS features are mocked in test environment
- Real-time features (WebSocket) are not yet tested

### Best Practices Followed
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
- **Clarity**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested
- **Coverage**: All critical code paths have corresponding tests
- **Speed**: Tests run quickly (<1 second total) for rapid feedback
- **Reliability**: Tests are deterministic and don't depend on external services

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update test data when API schemas change
- Add tests for new payment methods or features
- Review and update mocked responses to match real API changes
- Monitor test execution time and optimize slow tests

### When Adding New Features
1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Ensure both success and failure cases are covered
3. Add integration tests for complex workflows
4. Update this documentation with new test categories
5. **Add webhook tests for new payment states or transitions** ✅ **NEW**

### Webhook Testing Guidelines ✅ **NEW**
- Always test both successful and failed payment webhooks
- Verify database state changes after webhook processing  
- Test duplicate webhook handling to prevent data corruption
- Ensure race condition prevention with concurrent webhook tests
- Validate HMAC signature verification for security
